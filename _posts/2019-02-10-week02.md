title: Week 2
---

<!--- 
describe your own contributions to your team's efforts of building your browser extension

describe the state of your browser extension project: what progress your team make, what problems you encountered, will you have a working product by the due date

describe at least one thing about git or gitHub that you learned this week (something that was new to you) 
--->

Unfortunately, building the browser extension has not yet been started due to difficulty in contacting teammates. We will not likely have a working product by the due date, but we will try our best. 

I was previously unfamiliar with git, but I now know how to fork and clone a repository as well as add an upstream remote server.
