Unfortunately, building the browser extension has not yet been started due to difficulty in contacting teammates. We will not likely have a working product by the due date, but we will try our best. Our repository can be found [here](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s19/ToDoList-team13).

I was previously unfamiliar with git, but I now know how to fork and clone a repository as well as add an upstream remote server.
