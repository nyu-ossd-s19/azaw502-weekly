Unfortunately, building the browser extension has been delayed due to difficulty in contacting teammates. We will not likely have a working product by the due date, but we will try our best. Our repository can be found [here](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s19/ToDoList-team13). Our extension will provide functionality of a to-do list. So far, we have created the template for the to-do list. I have coded the HTML/CSS for it.

I was previously unfamiliar with git, but I now know how to fork and clone a repository as well as add an upstream remote server.
