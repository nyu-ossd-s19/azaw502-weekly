The project I have selected is [Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry). Sentry is an error tracking service written primarily in Python. I find it interesting as it monitors and fixes crashes in realtime, and has applicable usefulness to life as a coder. It gives users the power to debug errors and resolve them.
