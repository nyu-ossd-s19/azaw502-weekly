The most interesting thing about Kevin Fleming's talk was when he talked about how impactful the Bloomberg outage was to the world. While I knew of Bloomberg, I had never heard of that event before and I did not understand the extent to which the software impacts the financial world. I found the influence and usage of Bloomberg's key technology incredible, and the idea that a nation's finances could be impacted so heavily by a corporation is interesting. 

Regarding my teams progress and contributions, we have almost finished learning YAML and writing our challenge, we just need to make sure the tests run correctly and that it can run properly in the development environment. We have learned that integrating such things into large projects is often easier said than done, and there is a lot of work that has gone into this whole project.
