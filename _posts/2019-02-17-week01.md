Building the browser extension was rather confusing, as we had some difficult contacting each other and arranging the team. Collaboration was not particularly organized either, but it worked out as me and my partner both had different sets of skills to offer. He handled the JavaScript while I handled general design and HTML/CSS styling. It was easy to work with my partner after I figured out who he was, and we collaborated remotely. We did not meet to work on the code together. There were no serious issues in the design of the project, we both accepted the ideas of the other and simply made it.
