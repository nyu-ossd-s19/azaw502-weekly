We have successfully arranged our groups for FreeCodeCamp (we had too many people) and we are beginning to find issues that we can work on. At the moment, there are limited tasks we can work on, but we are learning the React.js and anticipating an issue popping up that we can work on.

Personally, I am not sure who contributes to Wikipedia, as one does not get anything back from contributing. If someone is particularly passionate about a topic, they may feel the need to add their knowledge about a topic, or if a grammatical error/typo is bothering someone, they may take the time to fix it on the spot, but I am not sure what would motivate someone to spend their day combing through pages and fixing them. I do not think I will become a regular contributor to Wikipedia. I wil find articles that are marked with problems and contribute my changes to those. 

I enjoyed the talk that Jimmy Wales gave on the Birth of Wikipedia, and I agree with the point that there is "lways a need for a certain amount of monarchy". I agree with this, and do not believe that completely decentralized systems can work, I believe that some level of authority is not only useful, but necessary to the function of these sorts of communities.
