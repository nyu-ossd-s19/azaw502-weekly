read Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software by Chamindra de Silva

blog about your take on using open source software in projects for social good and with humanitarian goals in mind (do you think such projects are easier or harder to get involved with, do you think involvement in such projects bring more or less prestige to the contributor (compared to other projects), would you want to be involved in a project like that?)

pick one of the humanitarian/social good projects that were mentioned in the slides, the articles linked, or anywhere else that you look for projects AND perform the project evaluation (following the same template as you did for previous projects)
