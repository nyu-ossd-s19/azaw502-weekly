I think projects with humanitarian goals in mind would tend to be easier to get involved with. I would imagine they would be more likely to be open-source, as they would not be profit motivated, and they would likely be a non-profit organization. Involvement in such projects would bring about equal prestige to the contributor in my opinion, perhaps a little less, as such organizations tend to be bring less fame. For example, the creator of some of the biggest Open Source projects may not be as well known as someone like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs (this may just be a result of Microsoft and Apple being much bigger companies, but I believe that for-profit companies have more potential to become a bigger company). That being said, I would be indifferent when contributing to a project like that. To me, I do not really care whether the goals of the project are humanitarian or not.
