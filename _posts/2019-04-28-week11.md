Our group continued to discuss the creation of a binary search tree challenge with the contributors of FreeCodeCamp, attempting to get our [pull request](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/35907) merged. I submitted my [own issue](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/35908) and [pull request](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/35912) regarding instruction text.
